# Skill Points

In zombs.io, there is an unused Skill Point system.

## Phenomenon

Each player has one skill point at the beginning of each game. You cannot gain skill points in any way.

Skill points can be used for either of these attributes: `damage` and `speedAttribute`. If you send an opcode `8` packet as an `Uint8Array` formatted like either of these:
```js
[8, 4] // for damage
[8, 18] // for speedAttribute
```
You can then use the skill point and `availableSkillPoints` will be `0`. Using the skill point for `damage` will have no effect, while using it for `speedAttribute` will give the player some extra speed.

## Cause

Explanation from one of the developers of zombs.io:

## Changelog

```md
(no changelog, or yet to be confirmed as having one)
```

With the fix, `availableSkillPoints` and `speedAttribute` were removed from player attributes and sending any opcode `8` packet will get you instantly disconnected.
