## Common Commands

- `pnpm run docs:build`: Builds the production application.

## Documentation Format

### Important Formatting Guidelines
- Do not use `---` to seperate each section.
- With every new page you create, add the page to the sidebar in `.vitepress/config.mts` if the user haven't already.

### Engine Documentation Format

The following page format is recommended, but not obligated as it does not handle edge cases.

```md
<!-- headers are case-sensitive -->
# `className`

descriptionParagraph

## `ClassName`

Extends `ClassName`. <!-- if applicable -->

### Properties
<!-- ... -->

### Methods
<!-- ... -->

<!-- 
    more parts can be added here, or inbetween the two above:
    - "Getters & Setters" - only add this if there are too many getters and setters
    - "Emitters", "Event Handlers" - only add this if the class has many functions that emit internal game engine events / are event handlers for engine events
    - etc...
-->

```

### When writing methods

````md

#### `methodName()`
```ts
function methodName(parameter: type): returnValue
```

````

### When writing tables

```md
| Head1 | Head2 | ... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| data1 | data2 | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

## Containers

::: tip

:::
